# FP
Simple Planetarium Program, designed for Grafkom. To run the code (I assume you already had the step from bu Anny) : 
1. Open Your codeblocks 
2. Choose Menu Setting, Compiler 
3. Global Compiler Setting, Linker Setting, on other linker option, add -lglu32
And dont forget to include imageloader.h and imageloader.cpp in your project !
